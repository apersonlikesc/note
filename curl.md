### The cURL project

A funny detail about Open Source projects is that they are called "projects", as if they were somehow limited in time or ever can get done. The cURL "project" is a number of loosely-coupled individual volunteers working on writing software together with a common mission: to do reliable data transfers with Internet protocols. And giving away the code for free for anyone to use.
### How it started
Back in 1996, Daniel Stenberg was writing an IRC bot in his spare time, an automated program that would offer services for the participants in a chatroom dedicated to the Amiga computer (#amiga on the IRC network EFnet). He came to think that it would be fun to get some updated currency rates and have his bot offer a service online for the chat room users to get current exchange rates, to ask the bot "please exchange 200 USD into SEK" or similar.

In order to have the provided exchange rates as accurate as possible, the bot would download the rates daily from a web site that was hosting them. A small tool to download data over HTTP was needed for this task. A quick look-around at the time had Daniel find a tiny tool named httpget (written by a Brazilian named Rafael Sagula). It did the job, almost, just needed a few little a tweaks here and there and soon Daniel had taken over maintenance of the few hundred lines of code it was.

HttpGet 1.0 was subsequently released on April 8th 1997 with brand new HTTP proxy support.

We soon found and fixed support for getting currencies over GOPHER. Once FTP download support was added, the name of the project was changed and urlget 2.0 was released in August 1997. The http-only days were already passed.

The project slowly grew bigger. When upload capabilities were added and the name once again was misleading, a second name change was made and on March 20, 1998 curl 4 was released. (The version numbering from the previous names was kept.)

We consider March 20 1998 to be curl's birthday.
### The name
Naming things is hard.

The tool was about uploading and downloading data specified with a URL. It would show the data (by default). The user would "see" the URL perhaps and "see" then spelled with the single letter 'c'. It was also a client-side program, a URL client. So 'c' for Client and URL: cURL.

Nothing more was needed so the name was selected and we never looked back again.

Later on, someone suggested that curl could actually be a clever "recursive acronym" (where the first letter in the acronym refers back to the same word): "Curl URL Request Library"

While that is awesome, it was actually not the original thought. We sort of wish we were that clever thoughâ€¦

There are and were other projects using the name curl in various ways, but we were not aware of them by the time our curl came to be.

#### Pronunciation
Most of us pronounce "curl" with an initial k sound, just like the English word curl. It rhymes with words like girl and earl. Merriam Webster has a short WAV file to help.

#### Confusions and mixups
Soon after curl was first created another "curl" appeared that makes a programming language. That curl still exists.

Several libcurl bindings for various programming languages use the term "curl" or "CURL" in part or completely to describe their bindings, so sometimes you will find users talking about curl but targeting neither the command-line tool nor the library that is made by this project.

#### As a verb
'to curl something' is sometimes used as a reference to use a non-browser tool to download a file or resource from a URL.
